## LAN's and slotted aloha
* Aloha existed prior to Ethernet. In fact, Ethernet's robust design to failure is based on slotted Aloha
* Aloha existed to send radio signals between islands to a central controller
* Aloha introduce d the concept of having slots such that frames can only collide in a slot. You cannot start transmitting in the middle of a slot

## LAN's and Wi-Fi
* Wi-Fi is why we learned about error recovery
* Wi-Fi is great in that we aren't tethered to anything but now we got issues
  * Direct path to access point can be blocked by materials
  * Environmental factors can corrupt data packets
* Many mobile protocols today rely on some form of error recovery to get the data from your computer out to where it needs to go and vice versa
* Example: mobile TCP's idea of node creates a TCP connection to router, router creates TCP connection to destination server
  * Believes that the "wireless" hop is what causes the worst loss
  * Requires router to have transport layer

## Bridging
* Just level 2 (doesn't peek above)
* Makes Ethernet span from just being point to point
* Abstracts the point-to-point concept to be like everyone is connected
* No address management
* Bridges are also called self-learning switches (because they are plug and play)
* Figure 1
* Spanning tree protocol (STP)
  * Rules of build:
    * Root bridge is bridge with lowest MAC address for the whole bridge network
    * Parent bridge is 1 hop above bridge on the path to root from designated bridge
    * Designated bridge is bridge with the shortest path to root bridge and won tie-breaker (has lower MAC address than other bridges that can reach root bridge in same distance)
    * Designated bridge keeps at least 1 interface alive (but usually keeps 2)
      * Interface to Parent bridge
      * Interfaces that service other nodes/bridges
    * Ports also have tie breaker of lowest port ID in the case 2 ports of same device end up on the same wire
  * In the case parent dies: 
    * Uncles/Aunts sense death -> turn back on ALL of the off interfaces
    * Children look for new path or link to root
    * "Build" algorithm occurs for this small subtree (localized reorganization)
  * In the case root dies:
    * Messages advertising alive timeout
    * Bridges flood the network competing who is root
    * Rules of build then kick back in global reorganization 
  * Resulting Spanning Tree is not the optimal spanning tree for all nodes
    * Main goal of the algorithm is just to break loops
    * Since bridges are purely layer 2, extremely fast
    * Everything is exact match on address
  * Bridges "still-alive message" is the hello message
