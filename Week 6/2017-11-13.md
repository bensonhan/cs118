###### Leonard Kleinrock
## 1. Data Traffic is Bursty and Asynchronous
* suppose two demands arise at the same time
  * queueing
    * perfect resource sharing mechanism
    * serves whatever work has arrived
  * splitting
  * blocking
  * smashing
* how fast can you serve?
  * can't control how much needs to be sent
  * but can control how fast packets are sent
* basic m/m/1 equation
  * response time grows number of people using it
  * if you scale up throughput and capacity you REDUCE response time
## Data Networks
* little's equation
* underlying principles
  * resource sharing (demand access)
  * economy of scale
  * distributed control
## Finite Population Models
* deterministic reasoning
* larger populations are easier to predict because of the law of large numbers/averages
* power = throughput/response time
* m/m/1 gives max power
* adjust so that on average there is one person in the queue
## How to do Research
1. ask yourself: is what you're working on going to be remembered?
2. don't fall in love with your model!
3. explore ("gee that's funny")
