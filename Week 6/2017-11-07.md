## Bridges vs. Routers
* why bridges are bad: large networks
  * 802 address is flat (like social security numbers)
  * routing address is hierarchical (like postal addresses)
  * inefficient spanning trees, doesn't take the most efficient path
* why bridges are good:
  * generality
  * cost: do less cost less
  * simplicity
* conclusion
  * bridges connect small number of compatible LAN's to form extended LAN's
  * routers connect extended LAN's
## IP Forwarding Addresses
* topology
  * everybody does peering
  * send router to peering point
  * google, microsoft, and fb have or are in the process of peered with every single provider
* basic internet in IP
  * originally IP only connected networks that didn't talk to each other
  * those networks died and IP has taken over
  * datagram: "post office model", each packet is different
